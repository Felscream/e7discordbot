A discord bot heavily inspired by YufineBot for the game epic seven

Since YufineBot doesn't update its database with new heroes as frequently as their releases, I wanted to create a bot which would be able to display new hero data.

Hero data is retrieved from [EpicSevenDB](https://epicsevendb.com/) using their [api](https://github.com/EpicSevenDB/api)
